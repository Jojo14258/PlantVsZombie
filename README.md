ITCH.IO GAME LINK WITH ALL INSTRUCTIONS:

How to run the game?

​1) Download the ZIP file from the itch.io webpage​.

2) Unzip the file [Entire folder has to remain together].

3) Open the unzipped folder and click on the .exe file named "PlantsVsZombies.exe" in the main folder to launch the game.


Running from python code:

If you want to start the game directly from the code, simply run the "main.py" file. (Note that you will have to install pygame (pip install pygame)  in this case)

Code is written in french so you may want to use a translator to understand the code.

WARNING : Each time you lose, you need to close the .exe file and reopen it. Due to time limitation, there's currently no restart button (sorry!). 

Your antivirus may detect this Python file as a virus. This is due to the fact that it doesn't recognize the editor. You'll need to create an exception for the folder.

Enjoy! :)
